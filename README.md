# lab-badge

Add a lab badge to any website by including a single JavaScript file.


## Usage

Just save the `lab-badge.min.js` file from this repository into the project, and add the following line of JavaScript to the site:

    <script src="path/to/lab-badge.min.js"></script>
    
E.G.

	<script src="http://thegingerbloke.github.io/lab-badge/lab-badge.min.js"></script>

That's it. The script will automatically initialise when the page has finished loading.


## Example

This repo contains an example HTML page that shows how to use the script.


## Source

This repo also contains the source code. If a change is made, the minified file needs to be manually recompiled.

This can be done with an [online compressor](http://refresh-sf.com/)


## Deploy

To publish `lab-badge.min.js` to Github pages (e.g. [http://thegingerbloke.github.io/lab-badge/lab-badge.min.js](http://thegingerbloke.github.io/lab-badge/lab-badge.min.js)), the file `lab-badge.min.js` should be copied into the root of the `gh-pages` branch
